        <!-- Context Section -->
        <section class="context-section">
            <p>In this project, my goal was to create a report similar to what a Strategic Analyst at Universal Music Group (UMG) might produce. I researched UMG’s use of Audisense to gather data on various audience segments and utilized AI to generate a sample database. Below are three insights derived from this data.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Segment Engagement Diversity -->
        <section class="report-section">
            <img src="segment_engagement_diversity.png" alt="Segment Engagement Diversity Chart">
            <div class="report-title">Segment Engagement Diversity</div>
            <p class="report-description">
                Casual Listeners show the greatest diversity in both artists and genres, making them the most versatile audience for targeting. With exposure to a broad range of music, they can be effectively reached with a more broad approach. On the other hand, niche groups such as Jazz Enthusiasts or Classical Aficionados tend to focus deeply within their preferred genres, resulting in less diversity. This indicates that they have strong, consistent preferences, and engaging them might require more tailored, genre-specific strategies.
            </p>
            <p class="follow-up">Future Question: Could we analyze which specific artists or subgenres Casual Listeners favor to target these broader tastes more effectively?</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Most Popular Streaming Service by Genre -->
        <section class="report-section">
            <img src="service_by_genre.png" alt="Most Popular Streaming Service by Genre Chart">
            <div class="report-title">Most Popular Streaming Service by Genre</div>
            <p class="report-description">
                Amazon Music stands as the leading streaming service for over half of the genres analyzed, showcasing its broad appeal across diverse music types. Interestingly, Spotify only dominated one genre, while Apple Music didn’t lead in any. This suggests Amazon’s advantage in reaching a wide music audience, while other platforms may be more specialized or less effective at genre-specific engagement.
            </p>
            <p class="follow-up">Future Question: What percentage of UMG’s genre catalog aligns with Amazon Music’s top genres, and how does this compare to Spotify's genre strengths?</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Device Type Dashboard -->
        <section class="report-section">
            <img src="device_type_dashboard.png" alt="Device Type Dashboard Chart">
            <div class="report-title">Device Type Dashboard</div>
            <p class="report-description">
                Desktop devices consistently rank first in usage, while tablets lag behind across all segments. However, the difference between devices is not substantial, indicating that user engagement is fairly balanced across platforms. This balance suggests that a cross-device approach in content delivery and marketing efforts could effectively reach audiences on their preferred devices.
            </p>
            <p class="follow-up">Future Question: Could a more detailed breakdown by specific device type (e.g., iOS vs. Android) offer deeper insights for targeted device-specific marketing?</p>
